# Spending-Tracker
Developed a desktop-based application to manage and track daily expenses. Implemented CRUD operations using JDBC with MySQL,  displayed data using Swing tables, and handled date and category based filtering to analyze recent spending patterns. We can generate the expenses report and it will be displayed in list and can be shared on entered mail.
